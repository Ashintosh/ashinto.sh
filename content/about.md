I'm Ash, and I created ashinto.sh as a space to share what I've learned about security, privacy, and the technologies that help people take control of their digital lives.

This blog is a place for analysis, experimentation, and practical guidance; not clickbait or ads. My goal is to help others understand and navigate the complex world of cybersecurity and privacy, while also sharpening my own skills.

Here, you'll find posts on topics such as:

- **Cyber threats**: Phishing campaigns, botnets, malware investigations, and other real-world security incidents I encounter.
- **Privacy and security tools**: Recommendations, how-tos, and evaluations of software and services that help protect your data.
- **Secure programming**: Tips, examples, and practices for building software with security and privacy in mind.
- **General InfoSec insights**: Commentary, analysis, and reflections on the security landscape.
